```{r}
library(MASS)
r = 1
draws = mvrnorm(n=43, mu=c(40.5, 17.8), Sigma=matrix(c(7.6**2, 7.6*3.4*r, 7.6*3.4*r, 3.4**2), ncol=2))
n <- 10
delta <- 100
draws[1:n,] <- c(10 + rep(40.5, n), 10 + rep(17.8, n))
plot(draws[,1], draws[,2])
mean(draws[,2] - draws[,1])
sd(draws[,2] - draws[,1])
sd(draws[,2])
sd(draws[,1])
min(draws[1])

aa <- 7.9
bb <- 3.9
cc <- 4.2

(aa ** 2 + bb ** 2 - cc ** 2) / 2 / (aa * bb)

sd(c(14, 47, rep(22.70 - .38, 41)))
mean(c(10, 25, rep(17.8, 41)))
```

These numbers imply that:

  * it's impossible to get that SD for the postop IOP with that range
  * it's impossible to get that SD for the postop IOP based on the SDs of the 
    pre and post-op IOP, even with perfect correlation

See also [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GAk17IsQLAPCaDcCOlyMdpP50TwOTW4c5o5JA73NFgI/edit?usp=sharing) where I assemble the numbers in the table in the paper.
    
I'm tempted to reject this paper because of this sloppiness.
