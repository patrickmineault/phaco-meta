TL;DR: the secret combination of invocations to get unicode within grid graphics
in RMarkdown is to use xelatex as the latex engine and the dev="cairo_pdf" for 
a given block.

$\Delta$ = Δ

```{r dev="cairo_pdf"}
library(grid)
vp <- viewport(x=0.5,y=0.5,width=0.9, height=0.9)
pushViewport(vp)
grid.text("Δ")
popViewport()
```
